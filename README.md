# HelloKotlin

I'm learning Kotlin and this repo has some things I learned.
This has Notes, Code and other things that were a bit hard or interesting for me when I learned Kotlin.

`notes/NOTES.md` has some important notes. These are notes I prepared while I was studying Kotlin. There isn't much there, but the ones present are important!
See [Notes](notes/NOTES.md) to take a look.

I hope someone finds this useful.
